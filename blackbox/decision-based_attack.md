Wieland Brendel, Jonas Rauber & Matthias Bethge

## 

different from transfer based attacks.
advantage: simpler, more robust to gradient-based attack, less hyperparameter tuning.

synthetic dataset used by Practical Black Box Attack?

criterion: median L_2 distance

use random walk + reject sampling to get adversarial examples. Too many queries. Is it possible to get that from a better start point?
